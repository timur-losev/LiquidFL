/*The RewardPoints class is linked to a RewardPoints movie clip in the library that will get attached to stage when triggeredby classes that want to show a point value floating by a hit, etc...*/class RewardPoints extends MovieClip{	//We want to create a couple of varibles to keep track of important RewardPoints information. 	//We must define them here		//This will just keep track of whether this clip is fading in or out	var fadeDirection;	//this variable will define how fast it fades	var fadeSpeed;	//This onLoad function is a built-in function of every movie clip. 	//When a RewardPoints is first loaded onto stage (it will get attached to the stage from the library) we want to:	function onLoad()	{		//Lets start it at 25 percent transparent.
