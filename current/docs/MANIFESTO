TESTBED MANIFESTO
Thatcher Ulrich <tu@tulrich.com> http://tulrich.com

I have put this project in the public domain.  I considered using one
of the standard licenses such as GPL, LGPL or Berkeley/X, but one of
my primary goals with this work is to make it as easy as possible to
reuse.  For various reasons, not all of them bad, much of game
development takes place in a closed-source environment.

Reinventing the wheel is only fun once; after that it's tedious and
annoying.  Having worked for several different companies on
closed-source projects and reinvented several wheels, I want to make
sure that work I do on my own time will continue to be available to me
for use both in personal and professional projects, no matter what the
licensing status or openness of those projects might be.

Likewise I've found it highly satisfying when I've released code that
helped other people's projects.  Placing this project in the public
domain lowers the barrier for others to adopt it.
