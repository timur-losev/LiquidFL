
Free Fonts
==========

Type Oasis has some good free fonts; would need to investigate
legalities before putting them in a game:

I've been working on and off on Tuffy, a Public Domain font family,

ActionScript Notes
==================

* As far as I can determine, "goto N" means the play/move/remove tags
  have been executed as if we played them from frame 1 through frame
  N.  No actions or other things get executed.  So it's just a way of
  updating the display list according to the standard timeline.  But
  there is persistent state for objects currently on the display list
  -- if a object has been modified via ActionScript (edit_text
  contents, or the matrix of a movie clip), and that object is not
  removed in any frame between the current frame and the target frame,
  then that object's state is unchanged when we goto N.

  Also, once an object's matrix is touched by ActionScript, it ignores
  subsequent move_object tags from the timeline.


* ActionScript identifiers are NOT CASE SENSITIVE???

* null and undefined are distinct???  Flash help says null is for
  missing parameters or return values, while undefined is for things
  that haven't been assigned yet.



Movie clip button events
========================

See test_cascaded_clipbuttons.swf/fla

Apparently, the behavior on mouse press is:

1. detect topmost character containing the event

2. proceed down from root (not including root) towards the topmost
   character under mouse: the first entity that has a clip handler or
   an onXXX function becomes the active entity, and receives the
   event.  (TODO determine what exactly is required to qualify for
   this -- is an onEnterFrame enough?)

   on (keyPress "...") {} qualifies (!)
   onDragOver
   onDragOut
   onPress
   onRelease
   onReleaseOutside
   onRollOut
   onRollOver
   
   onClipEvent (load) {} does NOT qualify
   onClipEvent (keyDown) {} does NOT qualify
   function onKeyDown() {} does NOT qualify
   function onEnterFrame() {} does NOT qualify
   function onKillFocus() {} does NOT qualify
   function onLoad() {} does NOT qualify
   function onMouseDown does NOT qualify (though it is triggered as well on any mouse down event; it's like a listener)


3. if the entity has *both* an instance clip handler and a onXXX
   function, the instance clip handler is invoked, followed by the
   onXXX function.
