Changes since the last public release (1.2.37):

version 1.2.38 [July 16, 2009]

  Revised libpng*.txt and libpng.3 to mention calling png_set_IHDR()
    multiple times and to specify the sample order in the tRNS chunk,
    because the ISO PNG specification has a typo in the tRNS table.
  Changed several PNG_UNKNOWN_CHUNK_SUPPORTED to
    PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED, to make the png_set_keep mechanism
    available for ignoring known chunks even when not saving unknown chunks.
  Added PNG_NO_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN in the PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED block of
    pngconf.h, and moved the various unknown chunk macro definitions
    outside of the PNG_READ|WRITE_ANCILLARY_CHUNK_SUPPORTED blocks.
  Added a reference to the libpng license in each source file.
  Rebuilt configure scripts with autoconf-2.63.
